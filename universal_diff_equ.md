# Universal Differential Equations

\toc

## How models has revolutionized scientific development

We as humans create models but this are misleading.
The article is about merging differential equations with machine learning to extract more *insights* from data.

## What is the Universal Approximation Theorem?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem) the Universal Approximation Theorem states that neural networks can represent a wide variaty of functions when given appropiate weights. The problem is that the theorem does not gives a way to construct such weights.
